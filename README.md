# Stopwatch - JavaScript

This repository contains a simple stopwatch implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The stopwatch allows users to measure elapsed time accurately, providing essential functionality such as start, stop, and reset.

## Features

- **Accurate Time Measurement**: The stopwatch measures time accurately using JavaScript's built-in `Date` object, ensuring precise timing.

- **Start, Stop, and Reset**: Users can start the stopwatch to begin measuring time, stop it to pause the measurement, and reset it to zero.

- **Display of Elapsed Time**: The stopwatch displays the elapsed time in a human-readable format, such as HH:MM:SS.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
